# Ideas to Extend DataChaEnhanced into a Web Application

This repository currently focuses on processing `.atf` files and advanced noise filtering for current trace data. To modernize the project and provide a user-friendly web interface, consider the following technology stack and feature ideas:

## Recommended Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) or [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) for building a reactive UI. Both frameworks offer server-side rendering and fast development.
- **Backend API**: Use **FastAPI** (Python) or **Flask** for quick API development. They integrate well with existing Python code for data processing.
- **Performance-Critical Modules**: Implement heavy computations in **Rust**, compiling to WebAssembly for use in the browser or as native modules on the backend.
- **Visualization**: Integrate charting libraries like **D3.js** or **Plotly** to display processed data interactively.
- **Containerization**: Use **Docker** to encapsulate the API and frontend for easy deployment.

## Feature Ideas

1. **Interactive Data Upload**: Allow users to drag and drop `.atf` files and immediately process them through the backend API.
2. **Real-Time Analysis**: Utilize WebSockets to stream processed data and display charts that update in real time.
3. **User Authentication**: Implement a simple auth system so users can save their analyses and revisit them later.
4. **Batch Processing**: Provide an interface to process multiple files concurrently, leveraging Rust modules for speed.
5. **Cloud Deployment**: Deploy the app to services like Vercel (for Next.js) or a cloud provider with Docker support for scalability.

These ideas aim to transform DataChaEnhanced into a full-fledged web application that is fast, scalable, and easy to maintain.
